# Voice-chat
This voice chat project is meant to be used as a VoIP over LAN to give the users a way of communicating over local network without being at the same room.

Once a server is opened on a system every client can join the chat room and communicate with each other, the system can have users assigned as admins to enforce martial law in the server.

Additionally there is full server log of every chat and action happening in the chat room.

P.S the logo is cool.
